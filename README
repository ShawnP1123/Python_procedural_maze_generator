Program that generates a maze using a simple backtracking algorithm.
Contact me at phillipsshawn53@gmail.com with any questions.

The algorithm simply carves a random path until it hits either a border or a tile it has already been to, at which point it picks a random tile that it has already seen and starts a new path from that point.
Rinse and repeat until every tile is connected

Change the cell size, the screen width and height in order to change the maze complexity, remember that more complex mazes will take longer to generate.

The time it took to generate is displayed in the console
